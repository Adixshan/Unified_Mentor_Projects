## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game board consists of a **3x3 grid**.
2. Players take turns clicking empty cells.
3. The script checks for a **win condition** (row, column, diagonal) after every move.
4. If no win is detected and all cells are filled, the game ends in a **tie**.
5. A **reset button** allows the game to be played again.

## ✅ Future Improvements (optional ideas)

- Add **score tracking**
- Add **single-player mode with AI**
- Include **sound effects** and animations
- Add **dark/light theme switch**
